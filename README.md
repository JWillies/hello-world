Hello to anybody and everybody who may come across this.

I am Jesse, someone who loves pretty much everything analysis related and working with data to get whatever insights I can.
I am self-taught in a lot of things, and I love learning new skills.
I'm forever curious, and that drives my passion for seeking out new things and experiences.
